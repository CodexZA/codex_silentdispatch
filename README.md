üìÅ qb-silentdispatch
Description:

qb-silentdispatch introduces a /dc (dispatch comms) command that allows police officers to send internal messages to other on-duty officers without triggering global dispatch alerts. Ideal for announcing status changes, call locations, or internal radio chatter in a clean, immersive way.

Only available to players with the police job, this tool mimics the real-world concept of back-channel comms or text-based MDT logs.

Why Use It:

Prevents dispatch spam for minor updates

Keeps communication within the police force

Clean message formatting and optional notifications

Inspired by TwitchRP‚Äôs internal communication systems
